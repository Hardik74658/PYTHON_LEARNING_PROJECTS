"""12. Logarithm 1 

The base of an exponent is the number being multiplied. For example, in the power 35, 3 
is the base.

Given a base and the result after raising it to a power, how do we find the power that was used?

Essentially, we would like to take the inverse of the exponential function. 

This inverse function is a logarithm written as “log”:

Calculating the logarithm log2(32) is the same as asking, 
“2 raised to what power is 32?” => That is 5.

What is log6(36^2)?
A.   1
B.   2
C.   3
D.   4
E.   6
