"""
Count the digits â€“ Poblem Description 
Take T (number of test cases) as input.
For each test case, take integer N as input and Print the count of digits of that number. 
Note: No of digits for number 0 is considered as 1.
Problem Constraints
1 <= T <= 100
0 <= N <= 100000000
Input Format
The first line is the number T which denotes the total number 
of test cases.
Next T lines contain an integer N for which you have to print 
the number of digits.
For T different Numbers, Print the number of digits in 
separate lines.
